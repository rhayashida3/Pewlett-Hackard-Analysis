# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

-Overview and Analysis-

Pewlett-Hackard has fallen a bit behind in the database department, so it will be a huge achievement to get this organized for the company. Therefore, several tasks were assigned to Bobby and myself by his manager, two of which are 1) determining the number of retiring employees per title, and 2) identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We are then tasked to write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. 


-Results-

	•	Based on the analysis, there were 133,777 employees born between the year of January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 (with duplicate records)
	•	Once duplicates items are eliminated, 90,399 unique records for employees born between the year of January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 (with duplicate records)
	•	The breakdown of job title of eligible retirees are as follows;
	    ⁃	Senior Engineer: 29,415
	    ⁃	Senior Staff: 28,255
	    ⁃	Engineer: 14,221
	    ⁃	Staff: 12242
	    ⁃	Technique Leader: 4502
	    ⁃	Assistant Engineer: 1761
	    ⁃	Manager: 2	
	•	There are total of 1,941 employees eligible to participate in mentorship program that were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.



-Summary-

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight.

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Approximately 90,399 employees assuming the worst case scenario of employees all retiring at the same time.


2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

This will depend based on what the demand is and how many newly hired employees Pewlett Hackard is going to welcome in - however we are certain that the company is able to provide mentorship program for up to 1,941 newly hired employees (within their field).
